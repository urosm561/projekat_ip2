Note: standalone version (in directories) of programs are named as "program_name.version.release[.exe]". To use it with RepeatPlus graphical interface StatRepeats and Repeats programs must be copied to the same directory where RepeatsPlusUI is located, and renamed to "program_name[.exe]", without version and release qualificators.
